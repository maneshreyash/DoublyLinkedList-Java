# DoublyLinkedList-Java
Extend the SinglyLinkedList.java to a doubly linked list (DoublyLinkedList class).    Use class inheritance to avoid unnecessary duplication of code.  Write a method    dllIterator( ), which extends the operations done by SLLIterator and adds methods    hasPrev(), prev(), and add(x).  The add method of the iterator should insert x before    the element that will be returned by a call to next().
